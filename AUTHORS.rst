Introduction
==================
the bible says that we can do it, at whatever cost we do have and that should not scare you at all
Agriculture forms part of the biggest revenue generators in Kenya, making it the 
back bone of Kenya’s economy accounting for 25% of the gross domestic product (GDP), 
at the same time accounting for more than 65% of Kenya’s total exports. 
The sector has grown to be one of the biggest employers for the massive youthful population in Kenya. 
However, the sector has been facing a plethora of challenges over the years, 
and as such has never reached its optimal performance. 
One of the major setbacks that has affected the countries agricultural
zones, is the over dependency on the bimodal rainfall pattern in the 
country for cultivation, with the remaining areas mostly experiencing
perennial conditions often juggling between the arid and semi-arid zones,
experiences of frequent droughts and crop fail in one out of every three seasons.

Rationale and Objectives behind CAMISTM
======================================================
The County Agricultural Management Information System, CAMISTM is a farmer-centric agriculture information management platform that integrates data connecting a farm to a given location with attributes for both the farmer information and land parcel properties. 
It is an ecosystem of tools and information services that enable real time stakeholders’ connectivity and 360-degree situation awareness of the full Food Production cycle.
CAMISTM creates a unified data flow of food production - enables stakeholders reliably forecast pre and in-season crop production as well as trace food production system.
This system creates an environment whereby vital farming information can be disseminated to and from the farmer concerning the farm parcel.
The growing need of having farmer information with integrated components was the key driver to creating a management information system, with farmer details on their attributes such as location, crop type, acreage of land under cultivation, the seeds and the fertilizers they employ, amount of harvest in the growing season etc. These attributes were solely for the purpose of documenting information on requirements and accessibility of farmers on pre and post-harvest management practices among smallholder farmers, while streamlining the role of extension services in ensuring the farmers get a good yield, while correlating the agricultural practices with the socio- economic and demographic characteristics of small holder farmers that influences their agricultural practices.
The pre- cultivation support would ensure that the farmer request for fertilizer subsidy from the county government. The farmer can also receive agricultural intelligence or specialized support from the government or agricultural extensions officers on the soil fertility conditions in terms of nutrients quantity such as phosphorus, nitrates among others. 
The post-harvest management will allow the farmers to report any pest and diseases, get information on when to harvest their crops and by extension get support on the route to market of their products. These support to the farmers will be made possible through the use of mobile extension services that disseminate knowledge, technologies and links farmers with the key actors in the market.

and the management using the CAMISTM system.
